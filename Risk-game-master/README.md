# Risk-game
Implementation of the 2-player Risk game and the AI to play it, for Math 335 Probability project.

## Paper
Look inside the folder [paper](https://github.com/kengz/Risk-game/tree/master/paper).


## Implemented Code Documentation
Look at the `html` files inside the [docs](https://github.com/kengz/Risk-game/tree/master/docs) folder, compiled with `Docco`.

## Chosen AI Personalities
Since there is 16 possible AI personalities, comparing all combination would require over 200 data sets (including varying player order), we handpicked only 5 personalities that seem stronger. This gives us 30 data sets, which is more reasonable to handle.

## Data Output (Ben, read this)
Download the `data` folder for the `JSON` files and data-transformer. There's a smaller test file titled `GS_test_1_1_1.json` for your experimentation.

Each `GS` (game series) is the result of 100 games played on the same configuration, specified by the number trailing the file name. e.g. `GS_2_10_1` would be for AI1 with personality 2, AI2 with personality 10, and the player order is player-1 first.

Start from the controls, which are `GS_1_1_1.json` and `GS_1_1_2.json`.


#### The data structure of `GS`

Each `GS` is an object, i.e. data wrapped within a pair of braces `{}`, within it is more nested objects. Object is a collection of key-value map, with syntax `key: value`.

We now interpret the data object `GS`; most of it should be self-explanatory. Note I've changed the data structure so it's simpler and faster now.


```js
{   // this is the GS where we played 3 games
    "1": {  // game #1
        "first_player": "p1",   // id of player who goes first
        "winner": "p1",         // winner of this game ("tie" if none)
        "AI1": ["Survival", "agressive", "cautious", "rusher"],
        "AI2": ["Survival", "agressive", "cautious", "rusher"],
        // below are time series, i.e. values at successive time
        // this game has 3 turns, thus array length = 3

<!-- So you can get the data by specifying the address, say at `['1', '1', 'p1', 'n_countries']` would be the value `14`. -->

<!-- If Mathematica's JSON parsing/data transformation is too hard, you may try out a simple data extractor `analysis.js` in the data file. The code runs on node JS, which you'd have to install (it's easy). If so you have to download this entire project. Instruction below. -->


#### Node.js
If you don't have `Node.js`, go to their website [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org) and install it (You may need to restart). To check your Node version, type into terminal

```bash
node -v
```


#### How to run it yourself
1). Have a desired project directory. e.g. mine is `/Users/kengz/Work`. Open your terminal; to navigate to that directory, type `cd ~/Work`.

**Tip:** You can auto-complete directory in terminal by typing `~/`, the first letter, then pressing the `tab` key.

2). At this Github page, copy the link at the `HTTPS clone URL`. (If you don't have `git`, simply download the zip file.)

3). Go back to your terminal, type `git clone` then paste the url, like:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kengz/Risk-game.git
```

4). Hit enter and let it install.

5). Go into the builder directory by typing 

```bash
cd ~/Work/Risk-game
```

6). Install the dependencies by typing 

```bash
npm install
```

7). The main file with parameter is `main.js`, modify as you like. To run it:

```bash
node main.js
```

You should see the output messages and built file.
